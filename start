## Snellius
Before learning any commands, it is important to understand why do we use Snellius. Snellius is a high performance  computer that we need to use because a typical PC cannot perform the analyses we do due to insufficient memory and power. For example, a laptop may have 16 cores. On snellius we are able to reserve 32,64,96,128 or more cores -for a certain amount of time- depending on what the analysis/task needs. 

To connect to snellius, you need to download tools that will enable you to connect via ‘SSH tunnel’. This can be mobaxterm or putty for windows, and tabby or putty for Mac(although there are other tools, maybe install for whatever you like by searching for ‘ssh clients for mac’). Hostname is snellius.surf.nl and port is 22.

When you log in to the snellius, it means you are in the interactive linux terminal. In this terminal, the command line ‘bash’ is used. So if you want to know simple commands of bash you can find this here(you will need directory and file operations sections more than others):
